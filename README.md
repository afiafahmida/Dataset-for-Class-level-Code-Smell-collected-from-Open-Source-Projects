# Dataset for Class level Code Smell collected from Open Source Projects


This repository accompanies the thesis **"Enhancing Code Smell Detection through Transformer-Based Deep Learning, Automated Machine Learning Optimization and SHAP-Based Explainability"**. It provides metadata, documentation, and sample scripts related to the dataset and framework described in the research.

## DESCRIPTION

The dataset consists of structural software metrics and labeled code smell annotations collected from multiple open-source Java projects. It supports research on automated code smell detection, transferability, and explainability using deep learning, AutoML, and SHAP.


<!-- ## REPOSITORY CONTENTS
